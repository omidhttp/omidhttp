# 🧭 Engineering Philosophy

These projects are not simple scripts — they are **control systems** built around:

- Event-driven execution
- External system orchestration
- Stateful automation flows
- Multi-actor Telegram ecosystems
- Payment and subscription lifecycles
- Redis-backed behavioral state
- Operational observability patterns
- Restart-safe workflow design
- Production-style deployment models
